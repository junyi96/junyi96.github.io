# junyi96.github.io
This is Lay Jun Yi's Github page meant to showcase my portfolio and website-making skills.

This website was made with Astro.
Work is still being done to prettify the website as well as finding projects to showcase in this Github page.

Below was the Astro starter kit used.  
# Astro Starter Kit: Minimal

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template minimal
```

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
